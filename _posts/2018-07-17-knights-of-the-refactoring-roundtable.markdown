Something that has been on my mind recently is how much programmers like to complain about code they've written.
No matter where I work, or what programmers I talk to I encounter programmers of all experience level lambasting code of days gone bye.
This is always a great thing! It's a sign of growth as you learn and as the community around you moves to newer and better ways of doing things.

On a similar and yet very different vein, having recently started a new job I've been thinking about getting up to speed
with what we do. As well as just observing a new environment and seeing people self select themselves for sprint stories they feel comfortable doing vs
sprints stories that invovle learning newer skills. Part of that is just due to finite time and enery to learn everything that goes into programming with
a modern stack now.

Combining these two thoughts in my head and as I worked on something that I viewed as less than absolutely productive I thought to myself about what sort of
things we had dedicated to at work. Every sprint we have a day dedicated to looking forward and building a new project, or working on spikes for future development
but rarely do we look backwards. Instead of spending time in our days of code base past we always spend time forging ahead, ignoring maybe the fact that a business
is loath to dump a product that works perfectly fine in their opinion, contrary to our gnawing and gnashing of teeth. The thought that came to me essentially boiled
down to let's carve out a day a month or maybe more if we can afford it to take a day and refactor old code.

Most of my team experience has been working on teams of 8-9 people, with varying levels of knowledge about the different domains of our systems. What I'd propose
is creating small roundtables to refactor. Teams of 3-4 people with a domain expert each diving into an ancient, outdated piece of code. By doing tasks like this
it should theoretically become easy to impart knowledge of a particular section of code, by helping properly refactor junior developers can learn best practices for
coding, design patterns and proper testing. This obviously shouldn't be the only method of transfering knowledge on a team, mixed in with typical paired programming
but I think it's a great way to carve out time to help facilitate knowledge transfer in a more focused manner without getting caught up in that feature deadline.
